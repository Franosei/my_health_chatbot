# Security Policy

FlynnMed handles health-related information and account credentials, so we
take security reports seriously and will respond promptly.

## Supported Versions

This project does not currently maintain multiple release branches. Security
fixes are applied to the `main` branch and the latest deployed version only.

| Version         | Supported          |
| --------------- | ------------------- |
| `main` (latest)  | :white_check_mark:  |
| Older commits    | :x:                  |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**
Public issues are visible to everyone immediately, including anyone who might
exploit the report before a fix ships.

Instead, report it privately using one of these channels, in order of
preference:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories** (preferred): open a
   [private security advisory](https://github.com/Franosei/my_health_chatbot/security/advisories/new)
   for this repository. This lets us discuss and fix the issue with you before
   it's public.
2. **Email**: send details to **oseifrancis633@gmail.com** with the subject
   line `SECURITY: <short description>`.

Please include as much of the following as you can:

- A description of the vulnerability and its potential impact
- Steps to reproduce, or a proof-of-concept (request/response, script, etc.)
- The affected file(s), endpoint(s), or component(s), if known
- Whether the issue requires authentication, and with what role/account type
- Any suggested remediation, if you have one

### What to expect

- **Acknowledgement** within 3 business days of your report.
- We will investigate, confirm severity, and aim to provide an initial
  assessment within 7 business days.
- We will keep you informed as a fix is developed and let you know before any
  public disclosure or advisory is published.
- We will credit reporters in the advisory/release notes unless you prefer to
  remain anonymous.

## Scope

Security reports are welcome for:

- Authentication/authorization bypass (`backend/api.py` token handling,
  `current_user` dependency, role-based access)
- Injection issues (prompt injection into clinical output, path traversal in
  document uploads, SQL/command injection)
- Data exposure across accounts (one user's records, uploads, or chat history
  becoming visible to another)
- Anonymization/PII redaction bypass in uploaded documents
  (`backend/anonymizer.py`, `backend/anonymization_agent.py`)
- Denial-of-service vectors specific to this codebase (not generic
  infrastructure DoS)
- Supply-chain issues in this repository's own dependencies or CI

### Out of scope

- This is an educational/portfolio clinical-AI platform, **not** a certified
  medical device and not currently deployed with real patient data under a
  clinical governance framework. Reports asking us to attest to HIPAA/GDPR/
  MHRA certification are out of scope -- data-handling hardening suggestions
  are still welcome as regular issues or PRs.
- Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies should be reported upstream
  (though letting us know so we can update is appreciated).
- Missing security headers/best-practices with no demonstrated exploit are
  best raised as a regular GitHub issue rather than a private report.

## Local Data Handling

By default this project stores accounts and health data in a local
`users.json` file and a local `data/` directory (see `.gitignore` -- these are
never committed). If you are running your own instance, treat those files and
your `.env` (API keys, `APP_SECRET`) as sensitive and do not commit or share
them.
