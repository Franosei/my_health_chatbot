"""
Structured health data extraction from uploaded clinical documents.

When a new document is ingested, this module asks the LLM to read the
document text and return all vitals, lab results, medications, allergies,
and conditions as structured JSON.  The calling code saves each item to
the appropriate UserStore collection.

Design principles:
- Only newly uploaded documents are processed (not re-processed on reload).
- Content-based deduplication: vitals are skipped if the same type + value +
  date combination already exists in the patient record.
- Medications and allergies are already deduplicated by name in UserStore.
- All extracted data includes a note marking it as auto-extracted from the
  source filename so users can distinguish it from manually entered data.
- No hardcoded clinical values, units, or ranges anywhere in this module.

You are a clinical data extraction assistant. Read the clinical document page shown in the \
image and extract ALL structured health data present -- including values that are only shown \
inside a gauge, badge, chart, or other graphical widget rather than as plain text.

Return ONLY a valid JSON object with these four keys: "vitals", "medications", "allergies", \
"conditions" -- same field shapes as below.

"vitals": array of objects, each with "type" (standardized snake_case key), "value" (string), \
"unit" (string), "recorded_on" (YYYY-MM-DD or empty string), "notes" (string, else empty).

"medications": array of objects with "name", "dose", "schedule", "reason", "started_on", "notes".

"allergies": array of objects with "name", "reaction", "severity" \
("mild"/"moderate"/"severe"/"unknown"), "allergy_type" ("drug"/"food"/"environmental"/"other"), \
"confirmed" (boolean).

"conditions": array of objects with "name", "status" ("active"/"past"/"resolved"/"unknown"), \
"recorded_on", "notes".

Preferred vital/lab type keys (use these when they match; otherwise create a concise snake_case \
key from the document's measurement name):
blood_pressure, heart_rate, temperature, weight, height, bmi,
oxygen_saturation, respiratory_rate, blood_glucose, haemoglobin,
white_blood_cells, neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils,
basophils, platelets, haematocrit, mcv, mch, mchc, reticulocytes,
hba1c, egfr, creatinine, urea, sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate,
calcium, phosphate, magnesium, albumin, total_protein, bilirubin_total,
bilirubin_direct, alt, ast, alp, ggt, ldh, crp, esr, ferritin, iron,
transferrin_saturation, b12, folate, cholesterol_total, cholesterol_ldl,

psa, peak_expiratory_flow, peak_urinary_flow_rate, inr, aptt, d_dimer,
fibrinogen, troponin, bnp, nt_probnp

Rules:
- Extract ONLY values explicitly shown on the page -- do not estimate or infer.
- Do NOT include patient names, addresses, ID numbers, or any identifiers.
- Do NOT include normal reference ranges as values -- only the actual measured result shown in \
the gauge/badge/text for that test.
- If a section is absent, use an empty array.
- Keep the JSON compact -- no extra commentary outside the JSON object.
- Some measurement names are ambiguous across specialties -- use unit and surrounding page \
context (referring clinic, mentioned conditions, letter header) to pick the specific correct \
key, never a generic one when a specific one is available. Example: "peak flow" alone is \
ambiguous -- if it relates to breathing/lungs/asthma/spirometry (unit typically L/min), use \
peak_expiratory_flow; if it relates to urology/bladder/prostate/voiding/uroflowmetry (unit \
typically mL/s), use peak_urinary_flow_rate.
