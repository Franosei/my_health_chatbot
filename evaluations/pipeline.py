"""Thin wrapper connecting the evaluation harness to FlynnMed's real,
production end-to-end pipeline -- nothing here reimplements clinical logic
or modifies backend/ in any way.

Every case is run through `backend.rag_system.RAGEngine.handle_user_question`,
the exact same call the chat API uses. This exercises the full pipeline
(role routing, patient-history context, crisis pre-screen, moderation,
intent/risk classification, policy gate, pathway context, agentic evidence
retrieval, and response synthesis) unmodified.

Role handling: FlynnMed's role-aware behaviour (backend/role_router.py) is
driven entirely by the calling account's stored `clinical_role` profile
field, not by anything inferred from the message text. A case run with
`user=None` always gets patient-mode defaults regardless of what the
conversation says (e.g. "I'm an emergency medicine physician..."). To
actually exercise the pipeline the way a real account with that role would,
`ensure_eval_account()` creates a clearly-namespaced, one-shot, never-reused
account (via `UserStore.create_user`, an existing public API -- no new
backend code) with the role `evaluations.role_detection.detect_stated_role`
found in the case's own text, and `run_case` passes that account's username
instead of `None`. Cases with no detected clinical self-identification keep
using `user=None` (patient-mode), identical to before -- role_router.py's
own default for an empty profile is already "patient", so this changes
nothing for the common case, only for cases that actually claim a different
role. Because each account is used for exactly one case and never read
again, there is no risk of one case's saved trace/triage history leaking
into another's patient-history context.
